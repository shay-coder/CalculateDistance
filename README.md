# CalculateDistance
Write a program that allows the user to enter a time in seconds and then outputs how far an object would drop if it is in free fall for that length of time. Assume that the object starts at rest, there is no friction or resistance from air, and there is a constant acceleration of 32 feet per second due to gravity.
